        "Background": [
            "The Femoroacetabular Impingement Randomised controlled Trial (FIRST) is a multi-centre, concealed randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the effect of arthroscopic lavage (i.e. washing out the hip joint) versus osteochondroplasty (i.e. surgical correction of the hip impingement morphology) in adults aged 1850 years diagnosed with non-arthritic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). The protocol for the FIRST trial has been previously published [ \n       1] and provides more detail on the trial rationale, eligibility criteria, interventions, data management, and methods for limiting bias.",
            "FAI is a condition that causes hip pain in the young adult as a result of a size and shape mismatch between the femoral head and the acetabulum. FAI is typically classified into two sub-types; cam type (a misshaped femoral head) or pincer type (an over-covered or deep socket). Most patients have a combination of both types of impingement. With FAI, the femoral head (ball) and acetabular rim (socket) of the hip joint collide during hip flexion and rotation. This collision results in an impingement of the femoral head/neck/column on the acetabular rim, and patients experience hip pain. This pain can be a precursor to early hip damage such as cartilage delamination and labral tears of the hip. As the condition progresses, the resulting hip damage may lead to osteoarthritis of the hip [ \n       1].",
            "The rationale for the FIRST trial is based upon (1) an exponential increase in FAI surgery with resultant increased healthcare costs over that last decade, (2) worldwide disparity in perceptions about its utility, and (3) consensus that definitive evidence for or against surgical approaches is lacking. Therefore, the primary objective of the trial is to assess whether surgical correction of the impingement morphology (arthroscopic osteochondroplasty) with or without labral repair, in adults aged 1850 years diagnosed with non-arthritic FAI, provides decreased pain at 12months compared to arthroscopic lavage of the hip joint. Secondary objectives include measuring outcomes associated with the intervention and control groups (osteochondroplasty versus lavage) related to improved lifestyle, emotional health, and physical health.",
            "This trial is a parallel multi-centre, blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 220 patients who have been diagnosed with FAI, to determine the superiority of arthroscopic osteochondroplasty to arthroscopic lavage. Briefly, participants were recruited from experienced hip surgeons practicing at 10 participating sites based in Canada, Finland, and Denmark. Patients were allocated to one of two treatment arms using an online centralized 24-h computerised randomisation system. The randomisation system follows a computer-generated randomisation schedule in random block sizes of 4 and 8. Randomisation was stratified by impingement sub-type (cam versus mixed) and clinical centre. Study personnel monitor critical aspects of perioperative care and rehabilitation. We are assessing subject pain within 12months using a visual analogue scale (VAS) after surgery as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include function, health-related quality of life, post-operative complications, and costs. Quality of the surgery and complications, including re-operations, will be reviewed by an independent adjudication committee. Outcome assessors and data analysts are blinded to treatment allocation. The full study process is shown in Fig. \n       1.",

Other hip-related adverse events to be reported include, but are not limited to, hip instability, tendinopathy, re-injury of the labrum/cartilage, hip osteoarthritis post-surgery, and infection (superficial or deep).",
            "The HOS is a self-administered hip score that was designed to capture hip function and outcomes following surgical therapies such as arthroscopy [ \n         5]. The HOS has been shown to have the greatest clinimetric evidence for use in patients with FAI or labral tears [ 6,  7]. The SF-12 may be self-completed or interview-administered and will help document general health status and the burden of illness that FAI presents [ 8]. The iHOT-12 is a shorter version of the iHOT-33 designed to be easier to complete in routine clinical practice to measure both health-related quality of life and changes after treatment in young, active patients with hip disorders [ 9]. This questionnaire has been shown to be valid, reliable, and responsive to change [ 9]. The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome [ 10]. The EQ-5D comprises five dimensions of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). The EQ-5D has been used in previous studies involving patients with hip pain and has been extensively validated [ 11,  12]."
